# Artificial-Intelligence

Python code programmed using **_Object Oriented Design_** . **_Data Structures_** and high level **_Algorithms_** are used to solve problems using Artifical Intelligent Techniques(Non-Machine Learning, More Algorithms/Data Structure)

## 8-Puzzle.py

Programmed an **_AI_** to help solve classical game 8-Puzzle. I programmed **_4 Classes_**, a **_Node_** class, **_Tree_** class, Board class, and a PuzzleSolver class, I use my **_Tree Data Structure_** with given **_Nodes_** as states of the board to **_branch out_** all possible configurations of moves the board allows until the goal is reached using **_breadth first search_** but with some added components... I use methods to help **_optimize time complexity_** such as **_memoization_** so that the same board states would not get recalculated and I added a **_heuristic_** to help make my search faster, thus making my algorithm **_""Intelligent""_**
